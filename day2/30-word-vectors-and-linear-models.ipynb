    "The goal of this notebook is to learn to use Neural Networks for text classification, going beyond simple Bag of Words models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Train a shallow model which learns embeddings\n",
    "- Download pre-trained embeddings from Glove\n",
    "- Use these pre-trained embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind:\n",
    "- Deep Learning can be better on text classification that simpler ML techniques, but only on very large datasets and well designed/tuned models.\n",
    "- We won't be using the most efficient (in terms of computing) techniques, as Keras is good for prototyping but rather inefficient for training small embedding models on text.\n",
    "- The following projects can replicate similar word embedding models much more efficiently: [word2vec](https://github.com/dav/word2vec) and [gensim's word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)   (self-supervised learning only), [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) (both supervised and self-supervised learning). However hard to see inside. We will use them tomorrow.\n",
    "- Plain shallow sparse TF-IDF bigrams features without any embedding and Logistic Regression or Multinomial Naive Bayes is often competitive in small to medium datasets."
