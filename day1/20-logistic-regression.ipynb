For example [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression) has a nice worked example but only a small note pointing out that this is for two classes only. Maybe read this first, then try and extend it to multiple classes using the notation from the beginning of that wikipedia entry.\n",
